I need to make a short (15 min) presentation followed by a Q/A session on how to make new packages.

Hello new package authors,

Based on the number of new software packages being submitted to the project it seems that Bioconductor is more popular than ever.  Last release we added a hundred and ten new packages (a new record).

A lot of the popularity of this project is because Bioconductor packages have to live up to certain minimal standards (Nature Genetics thinks so too, e.g., http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n1/full/ng.2869.html). For example every Bioconductor package is expected to:

1) provide complete documentation so that new users will know how to use them
2) contain working examples that are run when the package is checked by the build system so that failure can be detected early.
3) cooperate with related packages within the project so as to facilitate code reuse and support reproducible research.

We hope you will agree that having such package guidelines is a big win for the whole community.

To help *you* contribute to Bioconductor, we are going to have a Google hangout (on air) to allow you to tune in, listen to some tips from Bioconductor package reviewers and then open up the forum for questions.

Webinar Invitation: Contributing your package to Bioconductor: guidelines and overview
Date: December 10, 2014
Time: 8:00 AM PST /11:00 AM  EST

Please 'tune in' December 10th at 8AM PST for a Google Hangout to discuss new package contributions.  And learn how to maximize the value of your package contribution to the Bioconductor community.
