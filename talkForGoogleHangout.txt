## Using resources here:
http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/buildingPackagesForBioc/

## And here:

I need to make a short (15 min) presentation followed by a Q/A session on how to make new packages.

## TODO:
 - make slides from this
 - find a place to check this in (Martin)?
 - be ready to test this tomorrow.



################################################################################
## Here is my outline for what I plan to cover

- outline the major goals for the Bioconductor project 
  - universal documentation 
  - code reuse and the importance of working together
  - reproducible research
  - assurance that the package still works as R evolves


- Resources for new package authors
  - package guidelines (show where they can be seen)
  - primer for new package authors (show where this can be found - next to the other 'how to's for devs)
  - the support site
  - the bioc-devel mailing list (for advanced questions)


- What do reviewers look for:
  - BiocCheck
  - code reuse
  - good documentation - it's not enough if only three people in the world understand it...
  - Why do people care abuot how my code looks? (code readability)

- What to do when it's time to submit your package
  - don't panic
  - put your packages into a single issue in the tracker (don't create new issues for each submission)
  - don't create new issues if you need to put up a new tarball (just add a new version bumped tarball to the existing issue)


- What package review is for:
  - To help your package be better/make sure that your package helps to meet the goals of the project
  - To help you to know more about existing packages in the space (people you should be working with)
