newPackageAuthorsHangout
========================

A small presentation and announcement for a Google hangout session for new package authors.

These are just support files so that we can be prepared for out 1st attempt at a question and answer session on the internet (and about a pretty popular topic).  A small presentation (ideally 15 mins) is here to introduce the topic and connect viewers with resources on the web that they will want to know about as potential package authors.
